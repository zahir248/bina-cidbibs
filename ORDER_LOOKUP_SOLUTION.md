# Order Lookup Solution

## Problem
Users were purchasing tickets using company emails during checkout, but not all employees had access to those company email accounts. This created a problem where the order confirmation PDF was sent to an email that the actual ticket holder couldn't access.

## Solution: Public Order Lookup System

### Overview
A public order lookup system that allows users to access their order confirmation and QR codes using their order reference number and email address, without requiring authentication.

### Features

#### 1. Public Order Lookup Form
- **URL**: `/order-lookup`
- **Access**: No authentication required
- **Input**: Identity Card Number/Passport + email address
- **Validation**: Verifies order exists and both identity number and email match

#### 2. Order Details Display
- **URL**: `/order-lookup` (POST)
- **Shows**: Order information, billing details, tickets purchased
- **Actions**: Download PDF and QR codes

#### 3. Document Downloads
- **PDF Download**: `/order-lookup/{order}/download-pdf?email={email}`
- **QR Codes Download**: `/order-lookup/{order}/download-qr-codes?email={email}`
- **Security**: Email and identity number verification, rate limiting

### Security Measures

1. **Identity Verification**: Orders can only be accessed by the Identity Card Number/Passport used during checkout
2. **Email Verification**: Orders can only be accessed by the email used during checkout
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse with 10 attempts per minute per IP
